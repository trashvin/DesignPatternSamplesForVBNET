Bridge Pattern
- Bridge is used when we need to decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
- Structural Pattern
- This pattern involves an interface which acts as a bridge which makes the functionality of concrete classes independent from interface implementer classes. 
- Both types of classes can be altered structurally without affecting each other.
